How It Works
1.MyThread Class:

Presumably, MyThread implements Runnable and defines a run() method where the thread's task is defined.

2.Creating Threads:

Two MyThread objects (thread1 and thread2) are created.
Each MyThread object is passed to a new Thread object (thread and thread3).
3.Starting Threads:

Calling start() on the Thread objects (thread and thread3) begins their execution. The run() method in the MyThread class is invoked concurrently by both threads.

4.Concurrency:

Both threads execute independently, and the output from their run() methods may interleave depending on the JVM's thread scheduling.

Key Observations
1.Separate Instances:

thread1 and thread2 are separate instances of the MyThread class. Each thread runs independently with its own copy of the MyThread object.
2.Thread Names:

If the run() method logs Thread.currentThread().getName(), the names of the threads will be something like:
Thread-0
Thread-1

3.Thread Safety:

If MyThread has shared data, make sure to handle thread safety using synchronization or other techniques.
